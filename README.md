# FOSS Donations

This is a personal collection of donation pages for FOSS projects and other
adjacent efforts, because I'm tired of keeping them on a text file that might
get obliterated the next time I attempt to perform an "exotic" operation to my
computer.

I'll try to keep this updated, but I don't make any promises that this list will
always be free of dead links.

The list order is alphabetical.
