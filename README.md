# FOSS Donations

This is a personal collection of donation pages for FOSS projects and other
adjacent efforts, because I'm tired of keeping them on a text file that might
get obliterated the next time I attempt to perform an "exotic" operation to my
computer.

I think this list could help others (and I doubt making this list public on a
pseudonymous GitHub account will change my security posture against current
nation state adversaries).

I'll try to keep this updated, but I don't make any promises that this list will
always be free of dead links.

The list order is alphabetical.

## Fundable
These projects accept direct donations in some shape, fashion, or form.

### [Bromite](https://www.bromite.org/)

This non-[Tor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tor_(network)) browser has
[ad blocking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_blocking), so this makes web
browsing on an Android device more bearable.  (I'm looking at you with contempt,
[Vanadium](https://github.com/GrapheneOS/Vanadium) - which can only be used on
GrapheneOS devices and lacks dark theme rendering of web pages and always-on
Incognito mode.  I don't give a hoot if installing Bromite via Droid-ify
[breaks](https://wonderfall.dev/fdroid-issues/) the Android security model - as
long as Michael Bazzell recommends some form of F-Droid, I'll keep my F-Droid
repository apps updated via Droid-ify.  Shut your mouth and either improve
F-Droid or make a better competitor to F-Droid.)

* [Info page](https://www.bromite.org/#donate)
    * Credit/debit card via [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/csagan5)
    * Cryptocurrency
        * Bitcoin
        * Ethereum

### [GrapheneOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GrapheneOS)

The alternative Android OS that Snowden recommends, back in
[2019](https://nitter.lacontrevoie.fr/Snowden/status/1175430722733129729#m)
before [_Permanent Record_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permanent_Record_(autobiography))
was published and in [November 2022](https://nitter.lacontrevoie.fr/Snowden/status/1588472045960327168#m).
GrapheneOS lets you experience which settings in out-of-the-box stock Android
come from are part of [AOSP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)#AOSP)
and which only exist with [Google Play Services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Play_Services).
GrapheneOS does custom Android OS correctly, even porting the latest Android
versions to its stable release channels than even Google itself for
out-of-the-box Pixels.

* [Info page](https://grapheneos.org/donate)
    * Credit/debit card via [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/thestinger)
      to lead developer Daniel Micay
    * Various cryptocurrency options

### [KeePassDX](https://www.keepassdx.com/)

This is the Android version of [KeePass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KeePass).
KeePassDX is influenced to be modern, like KeePassXC.  This works great,
especially if you simply want a copy your KeePassXC database
[protected](https://keepassxc.org/docs/#faq-yubikey-2fa) with a YubiKey 4/5 NFC
device to still [work](https://github.com/Kunzisoft/KeePassDX/wiki/Hardware-Key#yubikey)
on your Android device, via either [USB OTG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB_On-The-Go)
or [NFC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near-field_communication).

* [Info page](https://www.keepassdx.com/#donation)
    * [Liberapay](https://liberapay.com/Kunzisoft/donate)
    * PayPal for credit/debit card

### [KeePassXC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KeePassXC)

IMHO, KeePassXC is the best local password manager.  It's included in Tails
(well, the version that Debian Stable is stuck with, which isn't the fault of
Tails) and looks much better than the Windows native [KeePass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KeePass).
Need I need to say more?  (If only SoloKeys could implement
[`hmac-secret`](https://github.com/Kunzisoft/KeePassDX/wiki/Hardware-Key#solokey)...)

* [Info page](https://keepassxc.org/donate/)
    * Credit/debit card
        * [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/keepassxc)
        * [Liberapay](https://liberapay.com/keepassxc)
        * PayPal
        * GitHub Sponsors
            * But only individual pages for the three lead developers
        * Patreon
            * Two different accounts for client and browser add-on

### [Qubes OS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qubes_OS)

    * [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/qubes-os)
    * Several cryptocurrency options

### [Signal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_(software))
* Direct [donation page](https://signal.org/donate/)
    * Credit/debit card
    * Many cryptocurrency options
        * Zcash, but no Monero? C'mon!
        * Ironically, not even [MobileCoin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MobileCoin)
          is accepted?  Pathetic!

### [SoloKeys](https://solokeys.com/)
* Credit/debit card via [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/solokeys)
    * Though the most effective support is buying SoloKeys or contributing code

### [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia)
* [Donation page](https://donate.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:LandingPage&country=US&uselang=en)
    * This happens to be the English language and US country page
    * Find the donate link on the [homepage](https://www.wikipedia.org/) to
      correctly generated donate page for your locale

## Not fundable
These projects can't be funded with traditionally direct donations.

### [Betrusted](https://betrusted.io/)
* Contributing code back to Betrusted on [GitHub](https://github.com/betrusted-io)
  and debugging both [Precursor](https://www.crowdsupply.com/sutajio-kosagi/precursor)
  and [Xous](https://xous.dev/) is most effective
* Note: December 2022
* Support hardware hacker [Andrew "bunnie" Huang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Huang_(hacker))
  via [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/bunnie)
* Support software hacker and fellow collaborator Sean Cross via
  [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/xobs)

### [System76](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System76)
* Just buy System76 hardware for the most direct support
#### [Pop!\_OS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop!_OS)
* Show symbolic support with $1/month
    * Click on the "SUPPORT POP" button to create an account
