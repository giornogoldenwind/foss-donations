# FOSS Donations

This is a personal collection of donation pages for FOSS projects and other
adjacent efforts, because I'm tired of keeping them on a text file that might
get obliterated the next time I attempt to perform an "exotic" operation to my
computer.

I think this list could help others (and I doubt making this list public on a
pseudonymous GitHub account will change my security posture against current
nation state adversaries).

I'll try to keep this updated, but I don't make any promises that this list will
always be free of dead links.

The list order is alphabetical.

## Fundable
These projects accept direct donations in some shape, fashion, or form.

### [Bromite](https://www.bromite.org/)

This non-[Tor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tor_(network)) browser has
[ad blocking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_blocking), so this makes web
browsing on an Android device more bearable.  (I'm looking at you with contempt,
[Vanadium](https://github.com/GrapheneOS/Vanadium) - which can only be used on
GrapheneOS devices and lacks dark theme rendering of web pages and always-on
Incognito mode.  I don't give a hoot if installing Bromite via Droid-ify
[breaks](https://wonderfall.dev/fdroid-issues/) the Android security model - as
long as Michael Bazzell recommends some form of F-Droid, I'll keep my F-Droid
repository apps updated via Droid-ify.  Shut your mouth and either improve
F-Droid or make a better competitor to F-Droid.)

The alternative Android OS that Snowden recommends, back in
[2019](https://nitter.lacontrevoie.fr/Snowden/status/1175430722733129729#m)
before [_Permanent Record_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permanent_Record_(autobiography))
was published and in [November 2022](https://nitter.lacontrevoie.fr/Snowden/status/1588472045960327168#m).
GrapheneOS lets you experience which settings in out-of-the-box stock Android
come from are part of [AOSP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)#AOSP)
and which only exist with [Google Play Services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Play_Services).
