# FOSS Donations

This is a personal collection of donation pages for FOSS projects and other
adjacent efforts, because I'm tired of keeping them on a text file that might
get obliterated the next time I attempt to perform an "exotic" operation to my
computer.

I think this list could help others (and I doubt making this list public on a
pseudonymous GitHub account will change my security posture against current
nation state adversaries).

I'll try to keep this updated, but I don't make any promises that this list will
always be free of dead links.

Some general guidelines:

* The list order is alphabetical.
* This is the order of credit/debit card donations:
    * Direct (sort of rare, especially tax deductible)
    * [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/), which is tax deductible
      but has transaction fees
    * [Liberapay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberapay), which is tax
      deductible but has transaction fees
    * [GitHub Sponsors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub#GitHub_Sponsors),
      which is not tax deductible but at least covers the transaction fees so
      that recipients keep the full donation amount
    * PayPal, but only if other methods are scarce
    * Patreon, which isn't great for FOSS development but still mentioned if not
      many methods exist
* Highlight Monero or Zcash, if available

### Warning
As Casey Neistat would say in his smartphone reviews, this is a **very biased**
list (i.e., absolutely not neutral), as my opinions have ended up leaking out
throughout the list.  As a fair warning, inserting my opinionated thoughts was
done in a nonlinear fashion, so the order might not make any sense to outside
readers.

### Disclaimer
I have not been sponsored to list any of these projects.  If I use
certain software or hardware listed here, then I will mention that fact when
applicable and appropriate.  I also use these with my own money, if price
is applicable.

### Other informational tangent
I want to donate to as many open source software projects (and adjacent ones) as
much as I can.  Figuratively, I've been seeing the writing on the wall to donate
to FOSS projects for some time now.  Slowly but eventually, I've come to the
inevitable personal decision that I have to at least donate some money to all of
the FOSS projects I've benefited from.  However, there are many more than I can
remember in my mental memory/RAM (which fails for most lists longer than 5
items), so I'm putting them here.  Also, this isn't my only call to action to
donate, but I've seen a call to do so in February 2022 from
[Techlore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbSy-lZHLYw), as an example (before I
became extremely bored with Henry's videos, as his co-hosted Surveillance
Report podcast is much better than his own channel's videos right now in late
2022 - and now I'm even starting to simply skim Surveillance Report URL lists,
instead of actually listening to the 30 minute or longer episodes).

## Fundable
These projects accept direct donations in some shape, fashion, or form.

### [Accrescent](https://accrescent.app/)
Accrescent is an app "store" and repository that is designed to have seamless
updates and the UI/UX robustness of the GrapheneOS App [store](https://github.com/GrapheneOS/Apps).
(I use the term "store" lightly, as you don't actually purchase, unlike
proprietary apps from the Google Play Store or Apple App Store; but I ultimately
don't have a better term.  Let's move on before we end up like
[Kurt Gödel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_G%C3%B6del#Later_life_and_death)
when thinking about the [incompleteness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del%27s_incompleteness_theorems)
of human language - although I'm aware that Gödel starved to death due to
refusing to eat food not prepared by his wife after a close colleague of his was
assassinated during the rise of the Nazi Party.)  Keep an eye on this project,
as it has [reached](https://lberrymage.dev/posts/accrescent-alpha/) the public
alpha stage in mid-December 2022.

* Credit/debit card
    * GitHub Sponsors for the lead [developer](https://github.com/sponsors/lberrymage)

### [Aegis](https://getaegis.app/)
Aegis is the best [TOTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-based_one-time_password)
app on Android (i.e.: read as Google Authenticator compatible) for the 6-digit
2FA code that changes every 30 seconds.  Aegis allows for locally encrypted
backups and works with Seedvault backups (which is available on GrapheneOS,
CalyxOS, and LineageOS/DivestOS).

* Credit card through [Buy Me A Coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/beemdevelopment)
* Cryptocurrency methods (Bitcoin... and Nano?  Sorry, I'm mentally too old to
deal with cryptocurrency coins that aren't egalitarian, such as Monero.)

### [antiX Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AntiX)
AntiX is interesting, as it is one of the few current Debian-based Linux
distributions that voluntarily supports 32-bit architecture computers when its
upstream Linux parent Debian only has 32-bit support out of obligation and
desktop Ubuntu has dropped 32-bit support since 2017-2018.  Be mature and ignore
the visible anti-fascist messaging, or just don't use this if you're not mature
enough to handle differences in ideology.  (Clearly more than 90% of American
politicians are incapable of this - no wonder why the U.S. government can't
achieve anything nowadays.  Maybe Plato was correct and we should conscript
government leaders, instead of electing them.)  antiX is `systemd`-free, though
that's probably out of necessity to successfully run on 32-bit machines than out
of disdain for `systemd` as a computing "aesthetic".

### [Arch Linux](https//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arch_Linux)
Arch Linux is a do-it-yourself Linux distribution, though realistically most
people don't go too crazy with their respective Arch Linux installs.  Arch Linux
comes with `systemd`, but the [init](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Init) system
can be replaced with [another](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Init), though
this isn't really official (and you're better off installing
[Artix Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artix_Linux) if you want to be
`systemd`-free).  Of course, being `systemd`-free doesn't matter because of the
Arch Linux community [template](https://github.com/Qubes-Community/Contents/blob/master/docs/building/building-archlinux-template.md)
for Qubes OS.  As we say in yoga, if Arch Linux is feasible and compatible with
your practice (i.e., realistically achievable with your current tradecraft),
then go for Arch Linux - it's definitely an experience to remember, even if you
only do it once on bare metal.  Arch Linux would definitely be one of the ideal
Linux distros for me to install the `linux-hardened` kernel on, without 
compiling the `linux-hardened` kernel itself (no hate on Gentoo).  If you come
to any of my Linux talks in the future and start spewing vitriolic and
subjective hatred on `systemd`, then I **will** throw you out (along venue rule
lines and local laws, of course) - I am too old for that kind of childish
behavior.  Go back and watch some alt-right Linux YouTubers if you can't be
mature enough during my Linux talks when I'm trying to encourage nontechnical
people to use Pop!\_OS, Linux Mint, or elementary OS.  Anyways, the
[AUR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arch_Linux#Arch_User_Repository_(AUR)) (the
Arch User Repository) is one of the strong points of Arch Linux (or any AUR
compatible Pacman-based distro): you can install many packages that aren't even
available for Debian-/Ubuntu-based distros with little to no fuss.  (There is
one notable and personal example: installing Linphone on Arch Linux is a
seemingly impossible task... I hope someone packages Linphone properly for
native Arch Linux repos at some point in the future.  This is one of the few
examples where Debian-/Ubuntu-based distros are better than Arch Linux, though
edge or corner cases like these are extremely rare.)

        * As a word of advice, be careful of the name you choose when donating
          with a credit card - your name will be forever be displayed as a
          donor, if you're the type that wants to be a privacy, security, and
          anonymity extremist like Michael Bazzell.
* Arch Linux also has commercial sponsors and contributors
    * Most notable is Nitrokey

### [archive&period;today](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archive.today)
archive&period;today is the lean and mean alternative to the Wayback Machine.
There are some sites that archive&period;today won't work on or isn't all that
helpful, but I can't remember any at the moment.  I do remember that
archive&period;today can save Amazon reviews and product pages, which the
Wayback Machine can't.  However, this isn't a comparison of archive&period;today
with the Wayback Machine.  I'm sure that internet sleuths should look into
archive&period;today for internet investigations, such as for lost media
investigations (which is a subset of [lost works](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost_literary_work)).
archive&period;today is excellent for bypassing certain paywalls, such as
_The New Yorker_ and _The Boston Globe_.  However, I doubt that
archive&period;today will ever be as popular as the Wayback Machine anytime
soon.  However, if archive&period;today can save a page, then it won't be taken
down due to copyright strikes - unlike the Wayback Machine.  (This explains how
the newspaper paywall bypass mentioned earlier can still stand.)

### [Bromite](https://www.bromite.org/)
This non-[Tor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tor_(network)) browser has
[ad blocking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_blocking), so this makes web
browsing on an Android device more bearable.  (I'm looking at you with contempt,
[Vanadium](https://github.com/GrapheneOS/Vanadium) - which can only be used on
GrapheneOS devices and lacks dark theme rendering of web pages and always-on
Incognito mode.  I don't give a hoot if installing Bromite via
[Droid-ify](https://github.com/Iamlooker/Droid-ify) [breaks](https://wonderfall.dev/fdroid-issues/)
the Android security model - as long as Michael Bazzell recommends some form of
F-Droid, I'll keep my F-Droid repository apps updated via Droid-ify.  Shut your
mouth and either improve F-Droid or make a better competitor to F-Droid.)

### [CalyxOS](https://calyxos.org/) and the [Calyx Institute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calyx_Institute)
[Nicholas Merrill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_Merrill) is really one
of the few Americans not sleeping on the consequences of the Patriot Act after
the 9/11 attacks, trying to fight the good fight to preserve civil liberties.
Just take a quick glance at the respective sections for news from the ACLU, the
EFF, and the Freedom of the Press Foundation and you'll quickly see attacks on
civil liberties post-9/11 every single day.  Though out of scope for this
"listicle", the future could be very dark if we wait around for the government
to [(not) save](https://mises.org/library/anatomy-state) us like
[Superman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waiting_for_%22Superman%22) with
legislation the people actually need.  (Did you not play
[_Injustice 2_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injustice_2)?.) Anyways, I'm
putting CalyxOS here out of obligation, but not because I personally am
benefited from CalyxOS directly.  In this case, it's always good to have options
for alternative Android OS's, even if I feel like CalyxOS's software engineering
severely lags behind that of GrapheneOS.  However, although I cannot speak to
the Calyx Institute's work with essentially consulting with other NGOs on safe
internet usage, I think the Calyx Institute membership mobile 4G/5G Wi-Fi
hotspot is one of the few ways to obtain any form of ISP service with any
semblance of privacy post 2022.  If I have a _Mr. Robot_-inspired TV show, then
I'd definitely use the Calyx Institute mobile Wi-Fi hotspot for the Darlene
Alderson-inspired nomadic cracker character.  (Obviously this hotspot wouldn't
be activated near sleeping locations and sensitive opsec locations, but you get
the gist.)

* One-time donation to the Calyx Institute: https://calyxinstitute.org/donate
* Internet Membership: https://calyxinstitute.org/membership/internet
    * A really good mobile 4G/5G Wi-Fihotspot, especially if you live a nomadic
      life
    * Calyx Institute shines as a lawful good NGO performing social good
      services (for example, it runs Tor relays)
* CalyxOS Membership: https://calyxinstitute.org/membership/calyxos
    * Seems very expensive - not to be a moralistic gatekeeper, but you as a
      reader are definitely capable of installing CalyxOS if you've found
      CalyxOS on your own and thus save lots of money by simply installing
      CalyxOS yourself (use the web browser if you have more relaxed security
      posture - I can't remember if CalyxOS ever put back the manual CLI
      installation instructions back)
        * Also, I feel like CalyxOS doesn't have much of a value proposition
          over GrapheneOS if your target install device is a currently OEM
          supported Pixel device still within Google's official timeframe; and
          only marginally so for all of the non-Pixel CalyxOS devices.  However,
          I do acknowledge that I've had a extremely Google Play Services and
          proprietary Android app "vegan" opsec mentality with my phone since
          2019 - so I can live very well cutting out Google Play Services from
          my Android phone without severe IRL usability consequences.  I'm
          pretty sure Slack [works](https://plexus.techlore.tech/applications/slack)
          without Google Play Services, but I happen to have it installed (on a
          secondary user profile) with Duo Mobile that absolutely needs
          [sandboxed]() Google Play Services to work (but without any push
          notifications - you'll need to manually open the app as before or
          during the activation of the Duo prompt)

### [DivestOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DivestOS)
DivestOS is a true soft fork of LineageOS, which attempts to offer the option to
relock the bootloader on select devices if the user wishes to do so.  (If you're
seeing reports that relocking is not possible or irreversible, such as for the
OnePlus One; then I would say it's not worth bothering to relock the bootloader
for that particular device.)  I think it ports the hardened memory allocator
`hmalloc` from GrapheneOS.  However, I still view DivestOS in the same way as
LineageOS: good to give back some extended life beyond official OEM support to
various Android phones, but not comparable for absolute impeccable adherence to
upstream security patches like GrapheneOS.  For those who truly want to invest
in security, DivestOS is a stopgap measure for you to hold out while obtaining a
currently supported GrapheneOS device.  Regardless, I see the "value
proposition" (not to be super corporate-y) of DivestOS... but also I cannot
comprehend how all of these devices can be maintained by a single person.  Yes,
DivestOS is a one-person downstream project running on a shoestring budget.
(Also somewhat similarly true of Wikipedia, the Tor Project, the Internet
Archive, and Tails - in no particular order.)

### [F-Droid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-Droid)
F-Droid is the first app I install on any new Owner profile on an Android device
in order to get Droid-ify and Aurora Store.  (Sorry
[LineageOS for microG](https://lineage.microg.org/) - I can't deal with F-Droid
being installed as a privileged app anymore, as this will interfere with
Droid-ify.)  At least if I am setting up an Android device "in the woods", with
none of my current electronic belongings, then I will have to install F-Droid
after verifying the PGP signature on Linux (otherwise, if I skipped that, then I
would be ok with downloading Droid-ify straight from GitHub with no
verification).  (Call me stupidly stubborn, but this is why I have no sympathy
for you when you [tell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFz57zNR_M0) people
online to use an RSS feed reader to update Android apps, but ignore the fact
that every other person who just wants to live life will already be overwhelmed
when you even set up a GrapheneOS phone on their behalf with respect to
usability.  Just like how [Kakashi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kakashi_Hatake)
from _Naruto_ ultimately learned to value the lives of his teammates over any
given mission, I've come to value humane usability over legalist security
worship.)

### [FreeTube](https://freetubeapp.io)
FreeTube is an Electron-based YouTube client that lets you watch YouTube videos
and keep track of public YouTube channels without signing into a Google account
on your browser, watching YouTube on the browser on the rather slowly loading
`youtube.com` website, or even Invidious.  (However, if there are Invidious
issues affecting all Invidious instances, then FreeTube will inherit those same
playback issues, as I've causally observed.  For example, if subtitles aren't
working on all Invidious instances, then subtitles also won't work on FreeTube.)
YouTube's suggestion algorithm seems to keep working, even if you're using a
VPN, since the YouTube site tracks users via browser fingerprinting - which is a
deeper issue outside of the scope of my ever flawed evaluator armchair
assessment of YouTube as a whole.  I even believe this fingerprinting occurs on
Invidious - but to a lesser extent.  Actually, I'm hypothesizing that unless you
use FreeTube behind a VPN, then tracking via fingerprinting still happens on
FreeTube - unless you simply disable suggestions entirely in FreeTube's
distraction-free settings.  I follow enough YouTube channels to have my own
self-curated "click hole" and I don't need YouTube's algorithmically generated
to have the same feature.

### [GrapheneOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GrapheneOS)
The alternative Android OS that Snowden recommends, back in
[2019](https://nitter.lacontrevoie.fr/Snowden/status/1175430722733129729#m)
before [_Permanent Record_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permanent_Record_(autobiography))
was published and in [November 2022](https://nitter.lacontrevoie.fr/Snowden/status/1588472045960327168#m).
GrapheneOS lets you experience which settings in out-of-the-box stock Android
come from are part of [AOSP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)#AOSP)
and which only exist with [Google Play Services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Play_Services).
GrapheneOS does custom Android OS correctly, even porting the latest Android
versions to its stable release channels than even Google itself for
out-of-the-box Pixels.

### [Internet Archive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Archive)
Most known for the [Wayback Machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayback_Machine),
the Internet Archive is similar to Wikipedia in that it runs on a shoestring
budget, with respect to the service and bandwidth it maintains compared to other
for-profit entities, such as Google or Microsoft.  Internet mystery
investigators love the Wayback Machine, so learn to use it if you can't use
`yt-dlp` on Linux.

This is the Android version of [KeePass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KeePass).
KeePassDX is influenced to be modern, like KeePassXC.  This works great,
especially if you simply want a copy your KeePassXC database

device to still [work](https://github.com/Kunzisoft/KeePassDX/wiki/Hardware-Key#yubikey)

### [KeePassXC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KeePassXC)
IMHO, KeePassXC is the best local password manager.  It's included in Tails
(well, the version that Debian Stable is stuck with, which isn't the fault of
Tails) and looks much better than the Windows native [KeePass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KeePass).

### [LineageOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LineageOS)
This was my first "real" custom Android OS, so there's some sentimental value
for me when it comes to looking back at LineageOS.  (Technically, I used a
OnePlus One with CyanogenMod, until CyanogenMod shut down.
CyanogenMod/LineageOS 13 for Android 6 was definitely a dark age, but LOS was
basically fine to use LineageOS 14/Android 7 or LineageOS 15/Android 8 came
out.)  However, in 2022 and afterward, I've only depended on LineageOS
(specifically the microG unofficial fork) for the Samsung Galaxy Tab S6 Lite -
but I'm slowly discovering that Samsung figuratively forces you to bend your
back three times and hop through five and a half hoops to install a custom
Android OS with a bootloader that can never be relocked, thanks to the
[e-Fuse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung_Knox#e-Fuse) from Samsung
[Knox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung_Knox) security - thank you Samsung,
I hate this.  Anyways, although the Pixel Tablet lacks an audio jack, I've
almost always at risk of accidentally making it fall or break by pulling on any
audio jack device plugged into my tablet and thus destroying the tablet; but at
least it will be hopefully projected to have GrapheneOS support.

### [Molly](https://molly.im/)
Molly is a security hardened fork of Signal that offers a local message database
encryption with a separate password (this is why I have to use KeePassXC to use
a random 128 character password to unlock Molly), a FOSS variant (which avoid
any proprietary libraries, unlike the Signal app for Android), removal of
MobileCoin, and automatic blocking of Signal users not in your contact book.
There once was a time when Signal truly cracked down on any third-party fork of
the Signal client on Android, but things at Signal seem to have changed since
2020.  (However, I won't dig any of that stuff up, because the neurotic minutia
combing in those primary sources is genuinely painful to pull up.)  That being
said, you are [trusting](https://blog.privacyguides.org/2022/07/07/signal-configuration-and-hardening/#caveats)
Molly, as it updates every two weeks (unless there are security updates), on top
of Signal with respect to the total number of development entities to trust.
For more info, see the 2022 Signal Configuration and Hardening Guide from
[Privacy Guides](https://blog.privacyguides.org/2022/07/07/signal-configuration-and-hardening)
(which will probably be moved in the next two weeks to effectively remove all
mentions of GitHub's "front end" with respect to contributors, even though you
can't get rid of all of the contribution history for the
[site](https://github.com/privacyguides/privacyguides.org/graphs/contributors) -
and the [blog](https://github.com/privacyguides/blog.privacyguides.org/graphs/contributors) -
until the Privacy Guides team eventually does exactly that by moving everything
to a new repository to do exactly what I thought those people would never dare
to do).

### [Monero](https://www.getmonero.org/)
Monero is an established cryptocurrency that is private by default (with an
obfuscated blockchain) that has no artificial supply limit (unlike Bitcoin and
many other cryptocurrency coins) and can be mined by any processor (so, no need
to hoard GPUs in server farms or specialized processors just to mine Monero -
so, yes: your `X86_64` laptop can mine Monero, though IRL the speed honestly
won't be very high...).

### [Qubes OS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qubes_OS)
Edward Snowden mentioned using Qubes OS in
[September 2016](https://nitter.lacontrevoie.fr/Snowden/status/781493632293605376),
[December 2017](https://nitter.lacontrevoie.fr/Snowden/status/941020119609892864#m),
 and in [August 2019](https://nitter.lacontrevoie.fr/Snowden/status/1165607338973130752#m)
(right before _Permanent Record_ was published).  The last mention calls out the
usage of the Whonix gateway in Qubes OS.  The overall UX is rough, as the second
mention alludes to, but the security offered by Qubes OS is definitely real (as
the only potential competitor [Subgraph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subgraph_(operating_system))
hasn't updated since September 2017).

### [Signal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_(software))
Signal has been mentioned by Snowden many, many times - but I'll cover a few.
The FBI already [knew](https://nitter.lacontrevoie.fr/Snowden/status/661313394906161152#m)
Snowden uses Signal in November 2015; Snowden had a "regular" 
[PSA](https://nitter.lacontrevoie.fr/Snowden/status/778592275144314884#m)
praising Tor and Signal in September 2016; Snowden suggests using Signal,
instead of e-mail, for truly private communications in
[2019](https://nitter.lacontrevoie.fr/Snowden/status/1175437588129308672#m)
before _Permanent Record_ came out; and Snowden says that he hasn't died from
using Signal in [January 2021](https://nitter.lacontrevoie.fr/Snowden/status/1347217810368442368#m).
Signal isn't perfect - but Tor and Qubes OS are the same.

### [SoloKeys](https://solokeys.com/)
SoloKeys is an open-source hardware security key for
[2FA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-factor_authentication), which is for
the older U2F protocol or the newer FIDO2 protcol of [WebAuthn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebAuthn).
This is a good alternative to YubiKey Security Key (but not the YubiKey 5 NFC
for securing a KeePassXC database).  There's nothing wrong with the security
keys from [Nitrokey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrokey), but those residing
in the U.S. could simply source perfectly equivalent security keys from the Solo
1 series from North America rather than going across the Atlantic Ocean for a
Nitrokey device.  At the very least SoloKeys could help lower shipping costs to
those in the U.S. and North America.

* Credit/debit card via [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/solokeys)
    * Though the most effective support is buying SoloKeys or contributing code

### [Tails](https://tails.boum.org/)
[Praised](https://nitter.1d4.us/Snowden/status/1165297667490103302#m) by Snowden
for a long time, Tails is a solid tool that is an entire OS that forces all web
traffic through Tor and is much easier to use than Qubes with Whonix (if you're
ok with turning off your computer and understanding the implications of the
security and threat model of Tails - while not rocket science, this takes some
getting used to).

### [Tor Project](https://www.torproject.org/)
The Tor Project maintains the Tor Browser, which Snowden has regularly
[praised](https://blog.torproject.org/what-tor-supporter-looks-edward-snowden/).
Honestly, if it's safe for you to use Tor, use Tor Browser at least once a week
to do general web browsing not requiring login accounts to help users depending
on Tor users to blend in - if everyone claims to be
["Spartacus"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spartacus_(film)#%22I'm_Spartacus!%22),
then mass surveillance is rendered useless.  Though to be clear, using Tor
Browser is almost never as enjoyable as using a browser better suited for
clearnet/VPN web browsing.

### [VSCodium](https://vscodium.com/)
VSCodium is a [fork](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Studio_Code#Forks) of
Visual Studio Code that remove's Microsoft's first-party telemetry.  Yes, even
Big Tech has to ruin FOSS, and it's always up to the hacker community to push
back against the Big Tech vectoralists.  (If you use the AUR on your compatible
Pacman-based distribution, then don't be a weirdo like me and use the source
building `vscodium` package like me - instead, just use the binary
`vscodium-bin` package.)

### [Alpine Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpine_Linux)
Alpine Linux is a "darn small" Linux distribution, even more so on a technical
level than the default Arch Linux install.  The only shortcomings of Alpine is
that there aren't a lot of packages to choose from and there's nothing analogous
to the AUR for Pacman distributions closer to Arch Linux than Parabola or
Hyperbola.  Alpine is used to run Docker images - if that is a tool you
frequently use.

* Alpine Linux has corporate [sponsors](https://www.alpinelinux.org/sponsors/)
* Alpine Linux has list of actions one can do to [support](https://wiki.alpinelinux.org/wiki/Alpine_Linux:Contribute) the project

### [Droid-ify](https://github.com/Iamlooker/Droid-ify)
Droid-ify installs F-Droid repository apps without any permissions - unlike
F-Droid.  F-Droid isn't perfect by any means, but Droid-ify improves the UI and
UX of F-Droid.  Still, Droid-ify doesn't fix any of the fundamental issues of
F-Droid.  (If you want to keep an eye on a future app store that has the
unmatched power and seamless experience of GrapheneOS's [App store](https://github.com/GrapheneOS/Apps)
with the possibility of having the availability of F-Droid without its inherent
security shortcomings, then get to know the [Accrescent](https://accrescent.app/)
app store.)  That being said, I do not care what Privacy Guides has to say if
Michael Bazzell pays no mind to that group and Neo Store's UI feels as cluttered
(if not more cluttered) than the Google [Play Store](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Play)
itself.  (If Molly lets its users decide between using the auto-updater and the
F-Droid repo like actual adults, then I can manage my decision as as adult as
well.)

### Kali Linux

### [LibreWolf](https://librewolf.net/)
I have never used the `user.js` profile from [Arkenfox](https://github.com/arkenfox/user.js/wiki),
because I previously depended on the prior Firefox hardening guide from Privacy
Guides (which was carried over from the Privacy Tools days).  Then, when this
was no longer necessary [in 2021](https://blog.privacyguides.org/2021/12/01/firefox-privacy-2021-update/)
(c.f. this additional 2022 [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7-bW2y6lcI)
from Techlore as well), I haven't bothered to set up any new instance of Firefox
properly.  Instead, I simply use LibreWolf, which has all of the Arkenfox
settings out of the box.  (LibreWolf on Linux is awesome, because updating
LibreWolf is a breeze and even updating the AUR manually for Pacman-based
distributions with `paru` is ok - but allegedly the Windows version doesn't
auto-update?)  Anyways, LibreWolf [doesn't](https://librewolf.net/docs/faq/#why-dont-you-accept-donations)
accept donations, but at least readers can spread the word about LibreWolf - as
it has all of the privacy "tweaks" one has to manually perform anyways on
"vanilla" Firefox.

### [`linux-hardened`](https://github.com/anthraxx/linux-hardened): the hardened Linux kernel
This is the hardened version of the Linux kernel.  Currently, this is only of
interest to me if I had to install Arch Linux on bare metal - as there I haven't
figured out a reliable method for Pop!\_OS to completely stop installing the
generic Linux kernel and requiring it as a system dependency; and the hardened
Linux kernel doesn't matter in Qubes OS.

* ArchWiki [info](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Security#Kernel_hardening)
* I suppose the most significant contribution is to maintain the code - if you
  have the relevant skills.  To be honest, this is the type of project where
  people self-sort themselves, as mentioned in the [book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cathedral_and_the_Bazaar)
  _The Cathedral and the Bazaar_.

### [Linux kernel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_kernel)

The Linux kernel is the colloquial "engine" that powers Linux.  We don't need to
do the whole Richard Stallman "GNU+Linux" thing, though Linux is analogous to
only the engine of a car and nothing else.  However, I am hesitant to stick
steadfast with the GNU Utils (or any other window manager/desktop environment as
the graphical interface), since there are people with legitimate needs
reimplementing the GNU Core Utilities and the GNU C Library and all that
technical jazz.  Let's just be pragmatic and just use "Linux" to refer to Linux
distributions - as anything else GNU or otherwise to make the OS livable, just
like seating and the rest of a car, is created to support the Linux kernel.

* [Homepage](https://kernel.org/)
* There are many people working on the Linux kernel, but feel free to contribute
  code for the most impactful contribution back to the Linux kernel, if you have
  the skill and know-how (I know - this is a "the chicken or the egg" problem,
  but it's the best I have right now)
* This is the day job of [Linus Torvalds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds)
  and many others to develop and maintain the latest/current stable version -
  including [Greg Kroah-Hartman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Kroah-Hartman),
  who maintains the current/stable the Linux kernel.  So, as of late December
  2022, the latest versions are either 6.1 or 6.0.


### [OnionShare](https://onionshare.org/)
Developed by computer security engineer and journalist at
[_The Intercept_](https://theintercept.com/staff/micah-lee/)
[Micah F. Lee](https://micahflee.com/) (the same man who maintains the
[`torbrowser-launcher`](https://github.com/micahflee/torbrowser-launcher) for
Linux distributions), you can share files over Tor with OnionShare.  There are
some other features, but those are more advanced than file sharing.

* Contributing back to its code on GitHub is the most effective way to help
  OnionShare.

### [System76](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System76)
System76 is one of the most pragmatic "I need a solution right now" for computer
hardware that is manufactured (as much as possible now) and assembled in the
U.S., compared to other large corporations making laptops in Asia.  (I'm looking
at you, Dell.)  The original 2018 Bloomberg
[story](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2018-10-04/the-big-hack-how-china-used-a-tiny-chip-to-infiltrate-america-s-top-companies)
about how China put "evil" chips on boards of Super Micro Computer Inc. servers
has details that are heavily disputed, as Amazon and Apple pretend that
everything is ok while the FBI is likely giving the "public" version that's very
different from the version that [IC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Intelligence_Community)
[sysadmins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_administrator) see from
[Heartbeat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permanent_Record_(autobiography)#Part_Three) -
but you already knew that if you read _Permanent Record_.  However, regardless
of who is lying (or if the whole ordeal itself is fabricated, as a counter
[analysis](https://theintercept.com/2019/01/24/computer-supply-chain-attacks/)
from _The Intercept_ indicates), the fundamental issue still stands: how do you
secure U.S. supply chains?  If there is an solution, then it's slow and requires
years of working trade knowledge of simply manufacturing
[ICs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit) and other
[PCBs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printed_circuit_board) within U.S. borders -
an industry that hasn't exactly flourished since the 1990s.  Yes, this could
alleviate some of the chip shortage that's been raging since at least 2019 (yes,
it started earlier before the COVID-19 pandemic started), but even U.S.
manufacturing wouldn't stop NSA interdiction of mailed computing equipment.
Don't believe me?  Watch both videos from the
[raison d'être](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/raison_d%27%C3%AAtre)
[post](https://www.bunniestudios.com/blog/?p=5706) for Betrusted/Precursor and
ironically mail [interdiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interdiction#United_States)
becomes much easier for [TAO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tailored_Access_Operations)
to perform.  In fact, once on Twitter (before half of those tweets were
deleted), you'll find out that [Ariadne Conill](https://ariadne.space/about/), a
main contributor to [Alpine Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpine_Linux),
cannot simply order ThinkPads from Lenovo, as the package will mysteriously be
redirected to [Langley, VA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langley,_Virginia)
from China, where the CIA headquarters is located (and the NSA effectively works
from there, too).  Apparently this is what a U.S. citizen is awarded with when
they maintain a Linux distro and works at [Chainguard](https://www.chainguard.dev/)
to secure software supply chains for the greater good.  I think JFK's most famous
[quote ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inauguration_of_John_F._Kennedy#Inaugural_address)
from his inaugural address requires a significant amount of reconsideration when
asking the question of how little the collective U.S. appreciates your work when
asking what one can do for the U.S. in 2022, all in the name of "national
security".  Anyways, Bernie Sanders is correct - the [CHIPS and Science Act](CHIPS and Science Act)
(also known as the "semiconductor spending bill") is a scam that helps the IC
cartels profit and [Andrew Huang](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YKdtHz9O2Mo)
agrees (and I'm actually surprised that Sanders came to the same
[conclusion](https://www.sanders.senate.gov/press-releases/news-sanders-opposes-all-blank-checks-to-chip-companies/)
as Huang).  Also, mail interdiction's seems like an expensive operation (even in
late 2022) and more fitting for targeted surveillance rather than mass
surveillance (the latter being much easier to fend off), so, realistically
speaking with a holistic approach, I doubt placing poisoned ICs onto PCBs is
happening on a massive scale.  The [Launch 1](https://system76.com/accessories/launch)
series keyboards have [QMK](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/)
[firmware](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/tree/master/keyboards/system76)
and both the mechanical and electrical designs are on [GitHub](https://github.com/system76/launch).
(I have the Launch 1.) (Interesting, there's QMK firmware for the
[IBM Model M](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/tree/master/keyboards/ibm/model_m_4th_gen)
and some [Unicomp](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/tree/master/keyboards/unicomp)
keyboards.)  Open source firmware and mechanical/electrical designs of System76
laptops and desktops will happen... when it happens.

#### [Pop!\_OS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop!_OS)
Pop!\_OS is System76's Ubuntu-based Linux distribution, which fixes many things
(with respect to software engineering and aesthetics) wrong with Ubuntu.
Eventually System76 will put its in-house designed COSMIC desktop environment on
Pop!\_OS in 2023 - so, at least I have something to look forward to in 2023.

### [`yt-dlp`](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp)
`yt-dlp` is a fork of [`youtube-dl`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youtube-dl)
that avoids the worldwide rate limiting, since `youtube-dl` didn't seem to
recover with respect to software development speed after the RIAA legal bullying
in [November 2020](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youtube-dl#RIAA_takedown_request)
for some reason.

* There is a donation [page](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/blob/master/Collaborators.md#collaborators)
  for main contributing developers, where you can donate to each developer
  individually. This is a bit more difficult to figure out how to distribute
  funds, but it can be done if one is sufficiently motivated to do so.
